# Commently - Comment the web!

Commently is a Chrome extension that allows you to comment and have discussions over any webpage on the internet. More information: https://devpost.com/software/commently

## Recent developments
This extension might not work out of the box and may need several updates and/or fixes (the last commit before this information update was about 2 years ago). However, a web app is currently in the works to translate this idea into a more accessible platform. The source code for the same can be found here: [Web App](https://github.com/aannirajpatel/commently-web-app), [Backend](https://github.com/aannirajpatel/commently-backend).

4. Drag the `build` folder that is in `Commently/` onto anywhere on that Chrome Extensions page to import it. (Please keep the folder after importing, as Chrome uses that folder for whenever the extension's code gets used)
